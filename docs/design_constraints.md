# Design Constraints for ConnectSphere Dating Website

This document outlines the design constraints that must be considered during the development of the ConnectSphere dating website. Each constraint is explained in detail with references to implementation approaches and code examples from the current frontend implementation.

## 1. Authentication Constraint

**Constraint:** Application shall only allow access to authenticated users only.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implement a robust authentication system with registration and login functionality
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or similar mechanism for maintaining authenticated sessions
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login/registration page
- Implement route guards to protect authenticated routes

**Current Implementation Reference:**
The current frontend implementation has a mock authentication system using localStorage:

```javascript
// Example from find-yourself-one.html (simplified)
function checkAuthentication() {
    // In a real implementation, this would verify JWT tokens or session cookies
    const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn') === 'true';
    
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
        // Redirect to login modal or page
        showLoginModal();
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Usage
if (!checkAuthentication()) {
    // Prevent access to protected features
}
```

**Database Integration:**
- User credentials will be stored in a users table with hashed passwords
- Authentication tokens will be validated against the database
- Session management will be implemented to track active user sessions

## 2. Authorization Constraint

**Constraint:** Authenticated users shall only be able to perform authorized operations on the system.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Define user roles (e.g., regular user, premium user, admin)
- Map operations to permissions required
- Check user permissions before allowing operations

**Current Implementation Reference:**
The current frontend implementation has UI elements that can be shown/hidden based on user roles:

```javascript
// Example of how authorization would be implemented
function checkAuthorization(requiredRole) {
    const userRole = localStorage.getItem('userRole');
    
    // In a real implementation, this would check against a permissions system
    if (userRole === requiredRole || userRole === 'admin') {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// Usage
if (checkAuthorization('premium')) {
    // Show premium features
    document.getElementById('premium-features').classList.remove('hidden');
}
```

**Database Integration:**
- User roles and permissions will be stored in dedicated tables
- Role-permission mappings will define what actions each role can perform
- User-role assignments will determine individual user capabilities

## 3. Separation of Concerns & Modularization

**Constraint:** Your system design shall support easy modification to the User interface during design and development phase by applying the principles of Separation of Concerns & Modularization.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implement MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
- Separate data models from UI components
- Use component-based UI development
- Implement service layers for business logic

**Current Implementation Reference:**
The current implementation already shows some separation of concerns:

```javascript
// HTML structure (View) - from index.html
<div id="profiles-grid">
    <!-- Profile cards rendered here -->
</div>

// JavaScript (Controller) - from main.js
function applyFilters() {
    const profiles = document.querySelectorAll('#profiles-grid > div');
    const ageFilters = [...document.querySelectorAll('#age-20-30:checked, #age-30-40:checked, #age-40-plus:checked')];
    // Filter logic
    // ...
}

// CSS (View styling) - from styles.css
.section-title {
    font-size: 2.25rem;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: var(--dark-color);
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

**Database Integration:**
- Data models will be separate from UI code
- Repository/DAO pattern will be used to access data
- Service layer will handle business logic
- Controllers will connect UI to services

## 4. Central Data Repository

**Constraint:** All data needs to be stored in a central repository which can only be accessed through an appropriate application (Web, desktop, mobile etc.) to access and modify data.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implement a centralized database system (SQL or NoSQL based on requirements)
- Create a secure API layer to access the database
- Implement data access objects (DAOs) or repositories
- Enforce access control at the API level

**Current Implementation Reference:**
The current implementation uses mock data but is structured to easily integrate with a backend:

```javascript
// Example of how API calls would be structured
async function fetchProfiles(filters) {
    try {
        // In the real implementation, this would be an API call
        // const response = await fetch('/api/profiles?filters=' + JSON.stringify(filters));
        // const data = await response.json();
        
        // Mock implementation
        const data = getMockProfiles().filter(profile => {
            // Filter logic
            return true;
        });
        
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching profiles:', error);
        return [];
    }
}
```

**Database Integration:**
- RESTful or GraphQL API will be implemented for data access
- API endpoints will be secured with authentication and authorization
- Database schema will be designed to support all application features
- Data validation will occur at both API and database levels

## 5. System Modifiability

**Constraint:** The system shall be easily modifiable if some variation in the existing features has to be implemented without a major redesign.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use design patterns that promote extensibility (Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Implement feature toggles for enabling/disabling features
- Use dependency injection for swappable components
- Follow SOLID principles, especially Open/Closed Principle

**Current Implementation Reference:**
The current implementation uses some modular approaches that support extensibility:

```javascript
// Filter functionality that can be easily extended
function applyFilters() {
    const profiles = document.querySelectorAll('#profiles-grid > div');
    
    // Each filter type is handled separately and can be extended
    const activeFilters = {
        age: getActiveAgeFilters(),
        city: getActiveCityFilter(),
        gender: getActiveGenderFilters(),
        preferences: getActivePreferenceFilters()
    };
    
    // Apply filters
    profiles.forEach(profile => {
        let shouldShow = true;
        
        // Each filter type is processed independently
        if (activeFilters.age.length > 0) {
            shouldShow = shouldShow && matchesAgeFilter(profile, activeFilters.age);
        }
        
        // More filter processing...
        
        profile.style.display = shouldShow ? 'block' : 'none';
    });
}
```

**Database Integration:**
- Database schema will be designed to be extensible
- Versioned APIs will allow for backward compatibility
- Feature flags will be stored in the database
- Configuration settings will be externalized

## Conclusion

These design constraints form the foundation of the ConnectSphere application architecture. By adhering to these constraints throughout the development process, we will create a system that is secure, modular, and easily maintainable. The current frontend implementation already demonstrates some of these principles, and the full-stack implementation will build upon this foundation with proper database integration and backend services.

The next steps will involve:
1. Designing the database schema based on these constraints
2. Implementing the backend services with proper authentication and authorization
3. Connecting the frontend to the backend through secure APIs
4. Testing the system to ensure all constraints are properly enforced
